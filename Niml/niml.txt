h1 NIML
+small Non-Indented Markup Language

h3 Why NIML?

md <
Well, it's hard to write long, deeply nested documents, using an indented markup language.
Is it easier to write long, deeply nested documents in NIML? Not sure, probably not, maybe. Try it.
Ok then what are the benefits of NIML?

1. It feels more like a text format, than a markup language.
2. It's not indented, it fits nicely into a 80 character line.
3. No mandatory closing tags, so it's slightly less verbose than HTML/XML.

Which languages influenced NIML and what are their shortcomings:

1. XML - document structure - deeply nested
2. JSON - attributes - deeply nested, not well suited for handling text
3. TOML - idea of flattening document tree - doesn't handle text that well
4. Markdown - text first - doesn't handle tables and other HTML fancy things
5. C# Razor - simple code/text switch using @ sign -
6. HAML/YAML - bracketless tags, no closing tags - indented

Beside combining features of other languages, is there anything unique to NIML?
Yes, NIML features element indent processing instructions not found in any other well known markup language.

Processing instructions, what are these?

1. Append/prepend +/- signs to increase/decrease current level, eg.

table+ //add table element and enter
tr //add tr element to the last element (table)
+td //add td element to the last tr
+td
tr //add tr to table element

2. Use | to inline multiple elements

tr+ | td 1 | td 2 | -

3. Use @: @{el} to switch between text and markup

This is how you would embed @a { href: "http://niml.org" } link @: into the text body.

h3 Rules

h4 Inline text - self examplatory

h4 Attributes 

p { class: "lead" } Lead text

1. Proof of concept
2. Tightening spec

-----------------
Playing with mixing text and tags
This is how you would embed a <a { href=”#” } link /> into the text.

This is how you would embed a table: 
<table+
tr
+td <
This is a long text with embedded <a { href=”#” } <
link with lots of text written in
multiple lines. /> Text may span few lines. Once text mode is entered using >, it needs to be closed with >.10 >-
